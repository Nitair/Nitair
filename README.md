### About me ðŸ™‹
Welcome to my profile :)

I am mostly working with web related technologies like:
- NodeJS
  - Vue
  - React
  - Express
- PHP (but since I know JavaScript, I am rarely doing something in PHP ðŸ˜…)

My programming languages knowledge:
- JavaScript
- Java
- Python

Additional knowledge:
- Docker
- Docker Swarm
- MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB, Postgres

If I would have enough time, I would also create a website. If you want to contact me privately,
please use following email address (Firefox Relay which forwards the mail to one of my main mailboxes): `mkrxgl2hn@relay.firefox.com`
